## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Use descriptive variable names
- Avoid `any` type when possible

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement error boundaries where appropriate

### File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/           # Next.js app router pages
â”œâ”€â”€ components/    # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/          # Utility functions and services
â””â”€â”€ db/           # Database schema and migrations
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `file-card.tsx`)
- **Components**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `FileCard`)
- **Functions**: Use camelCase (e.g., `handleFileUpload`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_ENDPOINT`)

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:
- `feat(chat): add message history persistence`
- `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
